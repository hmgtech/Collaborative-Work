Introduction
The introduction starts with an image of two doors inside of which the code quality is being judged. Robert Martin asks the reader which door would represent your code?
He goes on to giving the solution to "How to wind up behind the right door?". The answer according to him is "Craftsmanship". Knowledge and Work are the two parts of craftmanship.He explains this with a simple example. Learning to ride a bicycle. A person could know all the physics fundamentals going into riding a bicycle and still fall down the first time he tries to actually ride the bicycle. Coding is NO DIFFERENT. He goes on to give a brief summary of the book. He divides the book in 3 phases. The first several chapters focusing on various coding practices to follow. The second phase consists of exercises where the reader has to transform a given code too reduce the number of problems present in the code. The last chapter is a Payoff as described by him. It contains all the heuristics and smells that we encountered while solving the second phase. This will build a knowledge base worth holding on while coding.
